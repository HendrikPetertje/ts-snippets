## TS Snippets

This repository consists out of small typescript files with different functions
and features. It's meant to be a small cheat sheet of code examples for
silver-searching.

I keep a "Labs" folder around on my machine with all kinds of repos like these
and use [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) to look for
snippets.

Installing TS in nodenv with ALE & nvim:

1. `npm install -g typescript tslint prettier`
2. make sure AleLint (in nvim) has autofix for all of the above
3. `nodenv rehash`
4. go to project folder and type `tslint --init` for basic config
5. start creating `.ts` files
6. compile `.ts` to `.js` using `tsc filename` or execute `tsc -p` for watcher
